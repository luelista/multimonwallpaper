    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

}   \b\fs36 Multi-Monitor-Wallpaper\b0\fs20\par
\par
\cf1\b Wof\'fcr ist dieses Programm?\b0\par
\cf0 MultiMonWallpaper gibt dir die M\'f6glichkeit, auf jedem Bildschirm ein eigenes Hintergrundbild (Wallpaper) anzuzeigen. Selbst unter Windows 7 fehlt diese Funktion.\par
\par
\cf1\b Wie benutze ich es?\par
\cf0\b0\'d6ffne einen Ordner, in dem Bilder gespeichert sind. Klicke auf ein Bild und ziehe es auf das Programmfenster.\par
\fs8       \~\fs20\par
Alternativ kannst du per Doppelklick auf einen "Bildschirm" im Hauptfenster eine Dateiauswahl \'f6ffnen.\par
\par
\cf1\b Gibt es Updates und weitere Informationen?\cf0\b0\par
Ja, bitte besuche folgende Website: http://max-weller.de/multimonwallpaper\par
\par
\cf1\b Wo sind die Windows-Hintergrundbilder gespeichert?\par
\cf0\b0 Diese Bilder liegen gr\'f6\'dftenteils in folgendem Ordner:\par
file://C:/Windows/Web/Wallpaper\par
\par
\cf1\b Wieviele Bildschirme werden unterst\'fctzt?\par
\cf0\b0 Version 1.0 unterst\'fctzt nur zwei Bildschirme. Ab Version 2.0 kannst du (theoretisch) beliebig viele Screens verwenden.\par
\par
\cf1\b Wo bekomme ich mehr Wallpapers her?\par
\cf0\b0 Im Internet findest du rauhe Mengen von sch\'f6nen Bildern. Ein Tipp: Gib bei der Google-Bildersuche deine genaue Bildschirmaufl\'f6sung ein, dann sehen die Wallpaper am besten aus, da sie zum Anzeigen nicht vergr\'f6\'dfert/verkleinert werden m\'fcssen.\par
\par
\cf1\b Darf ich das Programm weitergeben?\par
\cf0\b0 Ja, du kannst anderen dieses Programm kopieren, allerdings muss die Programmdatei \f1 mmwall.exe\f0  unver\'e4ndert und im Originalzustand weitergereicht werden. Es ist nicht erlaubt, dass Programm, oder ver\'e4nderte Versionen davon, zu verkaufen oder auf andere Weise gegen Geb\'fchr weiter zu geben.\par
\par
\b WICHTIG: \b0 Ich garantiere nicht daf\'fcr, dass das Programm wie vorgesehen funktioniert, und bin nicht f\'fcr Sch\'e4den, die es in irgend einer Form, insbesondere durch Fehlbedienung, verursacht, haftbar.\par
\par
\cf2\b Hinweis f\'fcr Benutzer von Windows XP und \'e4lter:\par
\b0 Als Dateityp muss unbedingt Bitmap ausgew\'e4hlt sein, sonst kann Windows das Bild nicht anzeigen.\cf0\par
